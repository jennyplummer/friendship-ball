# friendship-ball

This is my project for the second part of Code Kentucky's Web Development course. I have created a site that will allow you to find out the "Friendship Baller Rating" of a current NBA player - this metric is based on the percentage of assists to minutes played for that player. The data for this came from the [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#introduction).

But that's not all - for the very curious, you can use the Bae Bae Unit Converter. This will allow you to take the weight of an NBA player - or anything that can be measured in pounds - and convert it into Bae Bae Units, or BBUs for short. Bae Bae is a chonky calico cat that shares my home, and the BBU lets you know how many Bae Baes it would take to match the weight of a GOAT like Lebron James - 22.72.

With a bit more time, I'd like to clean up my CSS a lot - I was so worried about figuring out the JS parts that I didn't remember to design mobile first and for whatever reason, reverse engineering it made things a little muddled for me. For now I am happy that it seems to be displaying well enough on mobile and desktop, even though I know I have redundancies in the CSS code.

## Features

- Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
  - The data on the BBU page is stored in arrays and then displayed in the table of player weights
- Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celcius, kilograms to pounds, etc)
  - The BBU was invented specifically to make this feature come to life
- Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
  - The Friendship Baller Index page uses data from the above-mentioned balldontlie API, calculates a player's FBI, and displays it on the page.
 
## Directions

I have used GitHub Pages to deploy my project and have others test it - [Friendship Ball](https://jennyplummer.github.io/friendship-ball/)
